  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Pastelillos are a Puerto Rican dish, typically served as an appetizer. They are deep-fried meat pies, filled with many
    savory ingredients, such as ground beef, green olives, sofrito-seasoned onions, potatoes, and more! As they are very 
    filling, it makes for a great dish to have in cold weather, as it will warm you right up!</p>
  <p>In this recipe, <strong>we will be saving time by using frozen empanada dough and premade tomato sauce.</strong> However, feel free to
    make your own dough and sauce! When I was younger, this was what we would do. It would take a bit of time, but the effort
    would be rewarded with the end result!</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
    <li>1 pound of extra-lean ground beef</li>
    <li>1/2 of an onion, diced</li>
    <li>1/4 cup of tomato sauce</li>
    <li>6 large pimento-stuffed olives, diced</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons of sofrito</li>
    <li>1, 1.41 oz. package of sazón, seasoned with coriander and achiote</li>
    <li>2 small garlic cloves, minced and crushed</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon of oregano</li>
    <li>2, 14 oz. packages of frozen empanada dough</li>
    <li>4 cups of vegetable oil (or more as needed) for frying</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>

    <li>Meat Filling:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet pan over medium heat.</li>

      <li>Once cooked, add <strong>1 tablespoon of filling</strong> to the center of an empanada dough disc.</li>
      <li>Moisten the edges of the disc with water, fold the dough to make a half moon, and use a fork to seal the edges.</li>
      <li>Repeat steps for the rest of the filling and empanada dough discs.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Frying:</li>
    <ol>
